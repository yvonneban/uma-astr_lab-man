\section{How to use this manual}\label{sec:howto}

Hello friend! Welcome to my masterwork.


\subsection{Manual}\label{sec:howto_man}


\subsection{Prep and Script}\label{sec:howto_prep}

I have designed it such that most of the script for each class can be essentially read off the slides. You can also reference the teaching notes for more details.

\subsection{Worksheets and Handouts}\label{sec:howto_ws}

\textbf{NOTE: THE WORKSHEETS IN THIS MANUAL ARE \emph{NOT} PRINT READY!!} To compile print-ready worksheets, reference the next section, \ref{sec:howto_ws}: Using \texttt{.tex} files, and use the worksheet master document, \texttt{ws.tex}.

\subsection{Using \texttt{.tex} files}\label{sec:howto_tex}


\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Astronomy is the study of the heavens. As such, a fundamental limitation of the subject is that we do not, in general, conduct \emph{experiments}, only \emph{observations}, where we snatch jealously at the sparing scraps of information tantalisingly offered by nature. One could argue that astronomy lives at the very cutting edge of our knowledge, where the scientific exercises of hypothesis formulation and testing are most active and challenging.

Such lofty heights of intellectual endeavour are difficult to convey to the next generation of scientists; astronomy draws on physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, programming and computer science at an ever increasing rate, and sometimes even biology. Overwhelmingly, astronomy in the academic institution is presented either in lectures or in research projects involving data from observations. The lucky few may even get the opportunity to personally participate in a physical observation run at one of the awe-inspiring cathedrals of science that are the observatories. None of these formats apply to the Astronomy Lab.

Instead, Astronomy Lab is not so much about \emph{experiments} but more about the \emph{models} that we use in astronomy, which play a larger part in the formation of knowledge in astronomy as compared to other subjects. The in-class activities of the course provide an opportunity to teach students about astronomical models in a more engaged and hands-on manner than can be accomplished in a lecture. Using a variety of excellent pedagogical materials, ranging from web apps and planetarium software to experiments and physical models that the students construct themselves, the goal of the course is to use kinesthetic and self-guided exploration to let students learn and internalise the concepts and models of astronomy.

This manual was precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused schools to transition to remote learning, sometimes being as remote as the other side of the Earth. Through adapting this course for this mode, and then adapting it back to in-person classes, we drew from the trials and experiences therewith to formalise a robust programme that will minimise the work needed to plan and oversee the conduction of the course.

\section{Setup}\label{sec:setup}

\subsection{Course setup}\label{sec:setup_course}

The Astronomy 100/1 Lab is conducted in tandem with the Astronomy 100 and(/or) 101 courses and is required to be taken simultaneously.

\subsubsection{Schedule}\label{sec:setup_sched}
Each semester, 6 independent sections are held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of every school week at 12:20-1:10pm (1220-1310) and 1:25-2:15pm (1325-1415). Generally, a lead teaching assistant (TA) and assistant TA is assigned for each section. The workload can be split up amongst the assigned TAs so that each section is covered. There may also be assistance from undergrad TAs.

\subsubsection{Technical details}\label{sec:setup_tech}
Every class is held in the Integrated Learning Center (ILC) room S220. The room consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item 11 round tables at which students sit with power points (and table microphones)
\item 3 physically secured Macbooks at each table that can be accessed with one's NetID and have Stellarium installed
\item 1 central instructor's (standing) desk (``lectern") with elevated chair
\item 1 lectern computer controlling lights and A/V of room
\item Lights with 3(?) brightness settings
\item 2 wireless microphones, one handheld, one wired clip-on
\item 2 HDMI and VGA feeds each, ``Lectern Laptop" and ``Lectern Aux"
\item Digital document projector on left side of instructor's desk, ``Document Cam"
\item Whiteboards that wrap around the room
\item 11 eye-level screens with 2 separate feeds, ``A" and ``B", one located nearest each table
\item 4 screens located above instructor's desk, ``Stadium"
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Materials}\label{sec:setup_mat}
N.B.: Vis-\`a-vis worksheets, please reference Section ~\ref{sec:howto_ws}.

Every student gets an individual lab worksheet for each lab. Activities that involve teamwork at each table may have a table worksheet for each table. Copies of the syllabus and Stellarium guide may also be provided in hard copy. All materials and instructor presentations are copied on the class webpage on Moodle (Moonami, or Moodle in the Cloud).

All individual student submissions, including all end-of-class quizzes, are administered on Moodle. Table teams fill out and submit table worksheets in class.

Demo materials for specific labs are listed for each lab and can be found in the class supply room.


\subsection{Grade breakdown}\label{sec:setup_grad}
The total Astronomy Lab grade makes up 25\% of the overall Astronomy 100/1 course grade, and does not have a separate grade. The remaining 75\% of the Astronomy 100/1 course grade comes from lecture assignments and exams. Within Astronomy Lab, the grade assignment is broken down as shown in Table ~\ref{tab:grades}.

\emph{Before the end of class, set the Moodle Lab Quiz access password.}

\begin{longtable}{|m{0.45\textwidth}|m{0.5\textwidth}|}\hline
Pick up copies of lab worksheet, syllabus, and Stellarium guide.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{1}}\\\hline
Log in to Moodle, go to the Astronomy 100/101 Lab page, and fill out the Astronomy Background Survey. (The survey is graded on participation only.)
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{3}}\\\hline
Astronomy Lab grade makes up 25\% of the Astronomy 100/101 total grade.

\textbf{Submitting work or pictures that are not your own, or having someone else do it for you, is dishonest and will be dealt with harshly.}

Lab usually improves your overall grade, if you put in the small time and effort commitment needed.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{5}}\\\hline
If you miss a lab, look out for at-home makeups or scheduled makeup labs, and try to let us know ASAP.

Don't procrastinate on the project; it's not difficult, but is impossible if left to the last minute.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{7}}\\\hline
Stellarium is a planetarium software that simulates what the sky looks like at different locations and times.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{8}}\\\hline
Getting started
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you're using a lab computer, Stellarium is already installed and you can just pull it up. If you're using your own computer, download the correct installer from this website and install it. If your OS isn't available, you can use the web version.
\item Open the Location Window from the left-hand menu panel or by pressing F6. In the search bar under the top right menu, type ``Amherst" and select ``Amherst Center, United States".

Take note that it's ``Amherst Center", not ``Amherst" (that's in NY somewhere). Also, \textbf{do not type} into the ``Name/City" box. That renames the location.
\item Close the window and open the Date/Time Window from the left-hand menu panel or by pressing F5. Set the time to 7:00 pm tonight to see what will be visible.
\item Practice dragging the view with the cursor to view different directions. Note that to zoom in, you scroll \textbf{up}, and to zoom out, you scroll \textbf{down}.

\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{9}}\\\hline
In astronomy, we use angles to measure positions and separations of objects in the sky. Your position is measured by latitude and longitude. (These are angles measured with the vertex at the centre of the Earth. Where is the angle of your position measured relative to?)
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{10}}\\\hline
From your point of view, an object's position is given by \textbf{azimuth} and \textbf{altitude}. Similar to before, we take the vertex of the angle measurement to be your position. For altitude, the angle is measured relative to the horizon. For azimuth, the angle is measured relative to due north.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{11}}\\\hline
To compare astronomical positions independent of observer location, we use the celestial coordinate system. It's very similar to latitude and longitude, which correspond to declination and right ascension respectively.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{12}}\\\hline
Astronomers use the \textbf{sexagesimal} system for recording angles. Each degree is divided into 60 \textbf{arc minutes} (\si{\arcminute}), and each arc minute is divided into 60 \textbf{arc seconds} (\si{\arcsecond}).

Right ascension also measures angle, but it is measured like how we measure time, in hours-minutes-seconds. In right ascension, there are 24 hours in a circle of 360 \si{\degree}.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{13}}\\\hline

We will use a uniform grid to get a sense of how to consistently compare the angular sizes we see. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Stand with your eye/camera located 12 ft from the screen. 
\item Look at the floor plan to determine where you should stand. 
\item Sketch some things as they appear on the grid. 
\item Be consistent! E.g. if you are using 4 fingers at arm's length, always hold them out at full arm's length. 
\item Keep the worksheet to reference later about angular sizes.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{3}}

Now we'll do the same with your camera to calibrate it.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Hold your camera at the same position as before, i.e. 12 ft from the screen.
\item Zoom in as far as you can on your camera.
\item Take a photo of the grid. Use the photo to determine the field of view of your camera.
\item Answer the questions on your worksheet.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Look at the Stellarium view projected on the screens. It simulates a real-life view of the night sky at the same scale as the grid. 
\item Use similar things to those in Part 1 (fingers, coin, etc.) to estimate angular sizes and answer the questions on your worksheet. \textbf{Remember to be consistent! Hold your arm out at full length!}
\item Take a photo of the projected Moon like you did for the grid:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Fully zoomed in
	\item Held at 12 ft from screen
	\end{itemize}
\item Answer the questions on your worksheet.

Now let's calibrate your camera fully zoomed out. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Zoom out on your camera to 1x. \textbf{If your camera has 0.5x zoom or similar, do not use it.}
\item Take a photo of the grid from 12 ft. You'll see that the screen appears much smaller. Answer the question in the worksheet. 
\item Move your camera approximately 3 ft from the screen using a yardstick.  
\item Take a photo of the \text{new} grid, which has lines every \SI{5}{\degree}. Use it to estimate the field of view of your camera fully zoomed out. Answer the questions on the worksheet.

Pick up a copy of the lab worksheet. Also, get a table worksheet for each table.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{1}}\\\hline
In groups at each table, you will investigate how the angular diameter of a spherical body (a ball) depends on its distance from you. Discuss and agree on a plan for how to make measurements of the sphere to explore the relationship between its angular size and distance. Make sure each person makes \textbf{at least one} measurement of the ball's angular size and distance. Consider:
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item What distances will you make measurements from?
\item How will you measure the distances?
\item Will you repeat the measurement with different people? (This is called replication.)
\item What will you do if points disagree?
\end{enumerate}
Record your measurement on both your lab and table worksheets. Then, mark and plot your points on the table worksheet.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{3}}\\\hline
Look over the points plotted by your group and discuss the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do the points exhibit a pattern? How would you describe that pattern in words?
\item How might you describe the relationship mathematically?
\item Do all the points agree with each other? What factors might explain the differences we see?

Here are two pictures of (half) the Sun taken with the same telescope and camera half a year apart. There's about a 2\% change in apparent diameter. Which picture was taken in January? Which in July? 
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{5}}\\\hline
Now let's look at the Moon. What is the Moon's angular diameter? How much does that value change? Is it larger when it's full? What is a supermoon? 

Note that the Moon's angular diameter is actually SMALLER when it's close to the horizon because it's farther away than when it's high in the sky! It's a psychological illusion that the Moon feels larger near the horizon.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{6}}\\\hline
In groups of up to three,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start up Stellarium and find Mars.
\item Turn off the atmosphere and ground visualisations.
\item Zoom in on Mars until Stellarium renders its features.
\item Note Mars's angular diameter in the left-side info panel.
\item Open the Date/Time window. 
\item Record and plot the angular diameter versus right ascension of Mars at least once per month from Oct 2021 to Oct 2023.
\end{enumerate}

Where is Mars this month? 

When Earth is closest to a planet and "passes" it, they appear to move backwards for a brief time, much like when you pass another car on the highway. This is called retrograde motion.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{9}}\\\hline
Up to a few centuries ago, astronomers thought the Earth was the center of the solar system. They had to use epicycles to explain retrograde motion.

We'll do this demonstration as a class. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose the Moon is the size of a golf ball. On this scale, how big is the Earth? \textbf{Lower} your hand when you think the demo balloon is at the right size.
\item Now, how far away are the Earth and Moon on this scale? Lower your hand when you think the Earth and Moon are at the right relative distance.
\end{enumerate}
Relative to the size of the golf ball, this distance is the same as the as the distance from the Earth to the Moon, relative to the size of the real Moon. Hence, \textbf{the angular sizes are the same.} If you take a zoomed-in picture of the golf-ball at this distance and compare it to your zoomed-in calibration grid, you will find the golf ball has the same angular size as the real Moon.

As part of the extra credit project, take a picture of the golf-ball Moon from the to-scale distance.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Put the golf ball on a pencil/pen so you can hold it up. This will represent the Moon. 
\item The Moon orbits the Earth counterclockwise as seen from above the north pole (and similar for the Earth and Sun)Ñthe same way as you turned your head. Slowly turn in that direction with the Moon held out and look at how the Sun lights it up as you turn.

The phases are called, in order: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent. 

The Moon orbits the Earth once every 29.5 days from new moon to new moon. The Earth makes a complete rotation once every 24 hours. Hence, the Moon rises and sets once a day and only slightly changes in orbital position and phase over that time. 

Throughout its orbit, the Moon is visible in the sky at different times due to its position in its orbit.

Accurately visualising this combination of motions is challenging!

Sun max altitude over the year
\begin{enumerate}
\item Zoom all the way out while staying centered on the South horizon point.
\item Open Date/Time window and change the date to 21 September.
\item Find the time (to within a few minutes) when the Sun is crossing the meridian (azimuth \SI{0}{\degree}00\si{\arcminute} or \SI{180}{\degree}00\si{\arcminute}, running from due north to due south). What time is it? What might cause it to \textbf{not} be 12:00 noon?
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{4}}\\\hline
Sunset position over the year

\begin{enumerate}
\item Watch how the Sun moves across the sky on:
	\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item 21 June (summer solstice)
	\item 21 Dec (winter solstice)
	\end{enumerate}
\item Look at:
	\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item where in azimuth the Sun sets on each day
	\item the angle at which the Sun approaches the horizon at sunset

Sun max altitude over months from around the world

Work in pairs and have one person do each part.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open Location window and set it to: 
	\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item a city in the tropics at a latitude between N \SI{23}{\degree} to S \SI{23}{\degree}
	\item a city in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude between S \SI{24}{\degree} to \SI{66}{\degree}

Answer the questions on the Lab worksheet.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{6}}\\\hline
Plot the Sun's noontime altitude throughout the year for both parts in the grid. Make sure to record the values for the quiz.

Remember that Earth's axis is tilted by \SI{23.5}{\degree}. From Earth, this makes the Sun appear to move \SI{23.5}{\degree} north and south of the celestial equator.

This means that the Sun doesn't actually pass overhead for most of the world, whether at noon or any other time!
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{7}}\\\hline
You can explore for yourself how this affects the climate at different locations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the Location window and type into the ``Latitude" entry ``N 66d 30m" (note where the spaces are). You should see the red arrow on the map jump to a location north of Amherst Center. (Leave the longitude unchanged from Amherst Center (W \SI{72}{\degree}) so the time zone stays the same.)
\item Look at how the Sun moves across the sky throughout the day and throughout the year.
\item Repeat for a position on the equator.

You will be working as a team at each table. Make sure to fill your table number on the table worksheet and on the lab quiz later. Your table number is the number on the whiteboard behind your table.

Decide on your roles for Part 1 and write your names and roles down on the worksheet as well.

\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure everyone participates in observation \textbf{and} does calculation at some point in experiment 1 or 2. If you have a large group, you can repeat and check each otherÕs calculations.
\item Have people at the table begin recording dimensions and doing calculations right away. Don't wait to collect all the measurements or you'll run out of time.
\end{itemize}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{2}}\\\hline
Experiment 1: Light at distance
\begin{enumerate}
\item Push the sleeve on the front part of the flashlight all the way \textbf{in}.
\item Shine it at the whiteboard straight on from 0.5 ft away.
\item Decide as a group where the edge of the beam is and trace it on the whiteboard.
\item Measure the height $a$ and width $b$ of the beam.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{3}}\\\hline
Experiment 1: Light at distance (cont.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repeat the measurements at 1 ft, 1.5 ft, and 2.0 ft. Make sure to make your \textbf{own} measurements for the suggested values on the worksheet.
\item Fill in the table on the first part of the table worksheet with your measurements and calculations.
\item Plot the points on the grid.
\item Pick one more distance value at which to make measurements to improve your plot.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{4}}\\\hline
Experiment 2: Light at angle
\begin{enumerate}
\item Change roles for this experiment and write down your new roles on the table worksheet.
\item Pull the sleeve on the front part of the flashlight all the way \textbf{out}.
\item Shine it at the whiteboard at an angle of \SI{90}{\degree} (straight on) from 1.0 ft away. Use the yardstick to align the flashlight at the correct angle according to the protractor.
\item Measure the height $a$ and width $b$ of the beam, as before.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{5}}\\\hline
Experiment 2: Light at angle (cont.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repeat the measurements at \SI{71}{\degree}, \SI{47}{\degree}, and \SI{24}{\degree}. Make sure to measure from the \textbf{center} of the ellipse.
\item Fill in the table on the second part of the table worksheet with your measurements and calculations.
\item Plot the points on the grid.
\item Pick one more angle where the light intensity would match the value you obtained in Experiment 1 at 2.0 ft, and add your measurements to your plot.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{6}}\\\hline
\emph{Find a good plot to project for discussion.}

From your table, does intensity increase or decrease with: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item distance?
\item altitude (angle)?
\end{enumerate}

What distance, at \SI{90}{\degree}, corresponds to shining the flashlight from 1 ft away at an altitude of \SI{24}{\degree}?

Which effect is more important for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Earth?
\item a comet?
\item Mars?
\end{enumerate}
Compare the shapes of their orbits and their axial tilts.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{7}}\\\hline
Solstices: Summer

The Sun shines straight down on the Tropic of Cancer, \SI{23.5}{\degree} North of the equator.

At our latitude at the summer solstice, the SunÕs light is spread over an area almost as small as at the Tropic of Cancer, so the intensity is high and the ground and atmosphere heat most.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{8}}\\\hline
Solstices: Winter

The Sun shines straight down on the Tropic of Capricorn, \SI{23.5}{\degree} South of the equator.

At our latitude at the winter solstice, the SunÕs light is spread over a much larger area, so the intensity is much lower and the ground and atmosphere cool down.

We're actually a few million kilometres closer to the Sun in January, but thatÕs a proportionately tiny change in distance and not as important!

Astrology is so last millennium

The Earth rotates 1$\times$ per day, but it's also wobbling, or precessing. This motion is much slower: one cycle every 26,000 years. Because of precession, the North Star is not constant; it won't always be Polaris.

A full cycle of precession takes 26,000 years, and there are 13 (not 12!) constellations in the Zodiac. So, the Sun moves to a new constellation for a given date every 26,000/13 = 2000 years. Roughly how old is Western astrology? 2000 years!

Retrograde is all backwards

As the Earth ``passes" other planets in their orbits, they appear to move backwards for a brief time, much like when you pass another car on the highway.

Until a few centuries ago, when astronomers thought the Earth was the center of the solar system, they had to use epicycles to explain retrograde motion.

	\item Turn off the atmosphere and ground visualisations.
	\item Switch to the equatorial axis. (This is NOT the same as turning on the equatorial grid!)
	\item In Sky and viewing options, turn on constellation lines and labels as before.
	\item Centre and zoom in on Pisces.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Find Mars on the sky.
\item Plot the position of Mars every month for one year (i.e. once a month from June 2020 to June 2021).
\item Connect the points. How many days was it moving backwards (retrograde)?
\item Go back through the same period. This time, zoom in on Mars and take note of its magnitude, phase, and size.

Remember how the Earth's axis is tilted? This means that the Sun doesn't actually pass overhead for most of the world - not at noon or any other time!
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{3}}\\\hline
Instant altimeter - just add sun
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download and print the solar altimeter from Moodle. Try to use heavy paper if possible.
\item Cut out and fold according to instructions. Try to make everything as square as possible.
\item Set up your altimeter outside at:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item noon (1pm for daylight savings)
	\item some time two hours from noon.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Orient your altimeter so the left flap casts a shadow across the altimeter.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{4}}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{5}}\\\hline
Instant photometer - just add sun
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read off the Sun's altitude.
\item Take a second piece of paper/card and crease it in the middle.
\item Put it on the ground so one side is flat.
\item Prop up the other side so it is directly facing the sun. Is one side brighter than the other?
\item Take a picture of your altimeter and photometer.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{6}}\\\hline
If you can't print:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use any piece of paper and fold it like the altimeter (straight flaps on bottom and side).
\item Mark the side of the shadow and measure it with a protractor.
\end{enumerate}
We'll give extra credit for creative solutions to measuring the Sun's altitude!
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{7}}\\\hline
Find the azimuth and altitude of the Sun as given on Stellarium for the same location, date, and time as your altimeter readings. Do they agree with your measurements?

The angle the Sun shines at affects how much heat it provides. This is proportional to sin(alt).
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{9}}\\\hline
I need your light
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate sine of the following values:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item 90 (This should be 1. If it is not, make sure you are using degrees!)
	\item Sun altitude at noon (beware daylight savings!)
	\item Sun altitude at two hours from noon
	\end{enumerate}
\item In Stellarium, find out the Sun's altitude at noon on:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item the summer solstice (21 Jun)
	\item the winter solstice (21 Dec)
	\end{enumerate}
\item Calculate the sine of those two values.
\item Find the ratio between those two values.

Near, far, wherever you are

Magnitude is a measure of how bright something is. The brighter it is, the LOWER the magnitude.

Power is related to magnitude per the formula:
\begin{equation*}
P \approx 3 \times 10^{-8} \times 10^{-\frac{m}{2.5}}\ \si{\watt}/\si{\metre^2}
\end{equation*}
We'll talk about it in more detail in Lab ~\ref{sec:lab_09}.

Make sure you cover a full orbital period for the planet - this may be longer than an Earth year.
\item In your write-up on Moodle, answer the following questions:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find the brightest and faintest magnitudes of the Sun and convert these to Watts/\si{\metre^2}.
	\item Find the ratio of the Sun's dimmest brightness there to the dimmest value on Earth, and convert that to an altitude (as you did for Mars).

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Write $<$50, 50-200, 200-1000, 1000-5000, $>$5000 light-years at the top of 5 neighbouring whiteboards.}

\item \emph{Put a table worksheet at each table.}
\end{enumerate}
Pick up copies of lab worksheet and make sure your table has a table worksheet.

Take note of your table today as we will ask you to return to the same table and use the same star for the next lab.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{1}}\\\hline
How bright something looks to us on Earth is called its apparent, or visual, magnitude. This system goes back to ancient times, when the brightest stars were called 1st magnitude and the dimmest visible to the unaided eye were 6th magnitude, and 100$\times$ dimmer. Like many human perceptions, it's a logarithmic scale. Today, astronomers have extended the scale so REALLY bright things have negative magnitudes!

To compare stars on an equal footing, we use absolute magnitude, which gives the apparent magnitude they would have if they were 10 parsecs (about 32 light-years) distant. It's a measure of luminosity (total number of watts).
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{3}}\\\hline
We humans see 3 different colours: blue, green, and red. Similarly, we can use filters to determine the colour of stars by looking at the difference in their magnitude at different wavelengths using the equation:
\begin{equation*}
m(B) - m(V) = B-V
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
\item $m$ is the intensity of the star measured in each filter
\item B = blue, V = visual (green)
\end{itemize}
When B-V is lower, it means the object is bluer and therefore hotter. When B-V is higher, the object is redder and therefore cooler.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{4}}\\\hline
We can organise stars using their absolute magnitude and B-V value on a Hertzprung-Russell diagram, which we can see at this link. As absolute magnitude is related to luminosity, which we can relate to star size, and B-V is related to temperature, this also allows us to understand more about stars.

Note that temperature runs backwards (from right to left) plotted this way!
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{5}}\\\hline
Procyon (Stellarium)
\begin{enumerate}
\item In groups of up to 3, open up Stellarium and turn off atmosphere (A) and ground (G) visualization.
\item Find the star Procyon. From the information panel, find:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Absolute magnitude
	\item Color index (B-V)
	\item Distance
	\item Spectral type
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
It's a lot easier to find this info in Stellarium if you Configure (F2) the Information to show just what you need. If you use the web app, you will need to look up Procyon on Wikipedia and look in the information panel on the right side of its page.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{6}}\\\hline
Procyon (HRD mode)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to this website: \url{http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/geas/labs/hrde/hrd_explorer.html}
\item Under Plot Labels:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Set the x-axis scale to ``B-V color index"
	\item Set the y-axis scale to ``magnitude"
	\end{enumerate}
\item Click on the HR diagram where Procyon is located by its absolute magnitude and B-V value. (You can fine-tune the values using the sliders on the left.)
\item The app will find for Procyon:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Temperature (in Kelvin)
	\item Luminosity (in solar luminosities)
	\item Size (in solar radii)
	\end{enumerate}
\item Turn on the Main sequence and luminosity classes by clicking them.
\item Estimate where Procyon is located closest to: Main Sequence line (MS), red giants (RG), supergiants (SG), or white dwarfs (WD).

\emph{Assign constellation for each table.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Return to Stellarium and turn on constellation labels and boundaries.
\item In your assigned constellation, find the bright stars and pick one each. Then, find their properties as shown on your worksheet. If you are using the web app, use Wikipedia.
\item Time to draw on your art talents! On a blank piece of paper, draw circles representing your stars where:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item the diameter corresponds to its size (1 cm for the Sun)
	\item the colour corresponds to its spectral type according to the table
	\item they are labelled with their name and spectral type.

\item Sort by distance by clicking the up/down arrows in the Distance column.
\item Pick a different nearest star each and find its properties.
\item On the HR Diagram Explorer page, change the X-Axis Scale to ``Spectral type".
\item Copy your answers into the Table Worksheet and compare them.
\end{enumerate}
Think about the following questions. We'll discuss these at the end of lab.
\begin{enumerate}
\item On the ``List of stars" webpage, click on ``the nearest stars" and ``the brightest stars." Why do these look so different?
\item How do the stars you can see by eye at night compare to the Sun?

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Warn students to keep strings as taut as possible without pulling the tape off the whiteboard.
\item A common mistake is to measure the distance from the whiteboard instead of from the ``Sun" (the knot where the strings come together). Check a distant and nearby star to make sure what they've done makes sense.
\item Look for common mistakes, e.g., all the stars are the largest size balls, or the colours don't make sense (sometimes they choose balls for looks rather than accuracy).

When we look at the sky, it seems like everything is projected on a 'celestial sphere'. In actual fact, stars and objects in the sky are located at vastly different distances from us, and each other. Thus, the patterns we draw between them, such as constellations, might not reflect their real spatial relations at all!

We're going to get a better sense of the 3D distribution of stars the sky.

Question to ponder: Are the more distant stars that make up a constellation's figure more likely to be dimmer or brighter?

Galaxy types

Galaxies come in three major classes: Ellipticals, Spirals, and Irregulars. They can look similar, but be very different sizes.

A distant galaxy with a small angular size may be physically larger than a nearby galaxy with a large angular size.

We have a complete census of galaxies only for those relatively nearby our own Galaxy, the Milky way. Some are so faint and the stars so spread out that they've only been identified in the last decade. This is similar to how we only see the dimmest stars near the Sun.

When we plot all the nearby galaxies, we find that the Milky Way is part of a cluster of several dozen galaxies that make up what is called the Local Group. We will use the angular sizes and distances of these galaxies to find their sizes.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{8}}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{9}}\\\hline
Galaxy sizes
\begin{enumerate}
\item Work in pairs. On Moodle, go to the Galaxy Data Sign-up link for this lab and fill out your names at the next available galaxy.
\item Using a scale of 1 m for 500,000 light-years (2 m for 1 million (1,000,000) ly), have one person stand at a distance from the whiteboard corresponding to the galaxy distance.
\item Have the other person stand at the whiteboard and mark out a width that corresponds to \SI{2}{\degree} of angular width, as seen by the first person. (This is about the width of your thumbnail with your arm fully extended in front of you.) Then, trade places and repeat, to check for consistency.
\item Using this scale, mark out the size of your galaxy as estimated from its observed angular size, e.g. if your galaxy is \SI{0.1}{\degree} across, it extends 0.1/2 of the width you have marked out.
\item Using the same scale of 500,000 light-years per 1 m, estimate the true size of your galaxy.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{10}}\\\hline
Use the following colours to denote galaxy type:
\begin{enumerate}
\item E (elliptical)/Sph (spherical): Yellow
\item S (spiral) (a-m): Green
\item Irr (irregular): Blue
\end{enumerate}
If your galaxy is small enough to fit on a small piece of paper, draw it as a circle of the correct size and colour it in with the right colour. If not, get a piece of paper of the right colour and cut out a circle of the correct size to attach to your paper.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{11}}\\\hline
Local Group structure

Galaxies in the Local Group mostly lie on a fairly flat plane, so we have assigned them an azimuth according to the direction they lie from the Milky Way.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the direction of your galaxy relative to the Milky Way. Use the position of the Milky Way we have put up and azimuth values we have marked.
\item In that direction, go out the corresponding distance of your galaxy from the Milky Way, and put it down. Remember that the scale is 500,000 light-years per metre.
\item Mark the position on your worksheet.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{12}}\\\hline
The Local Group

Most galaxies are small (``dwarfs") and are members of clusters that range from a few bright galaxies to tens of thousands of them.

The large galaxies in the Local Group are spirals, but in larger clusters, the big galaxies are mostly ellipticals.

Pick up copies of the project worksheet. 
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{1}}\\\hline
Make sure to read and respond to the Photo Policy Acknowledgement on Moodle. Note that you won't be able to get any credit for the rest of the project otherwise. 
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{2}}\\\hline
Admiring the sunset for credit
\begin{enumerate}
\item You can take pictures of the sunset OR sunrise, but they must be consistent for all your pictures.
\item Pick a spot that:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item You can get to again regularly later in the semester
	\item Has a clear view of horizon
	\item The sunset(/sunrise) will shift along the horizon over time, so keep that in mind. In the spring, the sunset shifts north, which is to the right, and vice versa for the sunrise.
	\item Has features on the horizon that allow you to pinpoint how the sunset moves over time.
	\item You will precisely document so others can replicate your pictures.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{3}}\\\hline
Admiring the sunset for credit (cont.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take a picture:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item With your camera zoomed out to zoom factor 1
	\item Within about 5 degrees of the horizon
	\item In which the Sun's azimuth can be clearly discerned
	\end{enumerate}
Don't delete failed pictures!
\item Take pictures that precisely document the position you took your picture from. Someone else should be able to return to the exact same spot to take a follow-up picture.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{4}}\\\hline
Here are examples of acceptable pictures.

The Sun doesn't need to be directly visible as long as some way to pinpoint its location (both altitude and azimuth) is clearly visible.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{5}}\\\hline
These pictures are not acceptable for the project.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure there's some way to locate the Sun.
\item This means there must be features visible on the horizon to compare its position to. An ocean view isn't useful unless there are fixed features you can use, like islands.
\item Make sure you have some space along the horizon that will accommodate the sunset as it moves over time.
\item Photos from too long before or after sunset are not accepted.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{6}}\\\hline
Here are examples of ways to document your location so that someone else can use it to return to the exact same spot to take a follow-up picture.
\begin{enumerate}
\item You will probably need to include a map along with photos that show clearly where you are standing when you take your pictures.
\item Again, make sure features around your location are visible.
\end{enumerate}
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{7}}\\\hline
Take note of these deadlines. Don't wait to get your photos! They must be spaced a certain apart from your later photos.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{8}}\\\hline
Part 2

You should have taken your first sunset/sunrise photo. You will take another 2 follow-up sunset pictures after your first one.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take your 2nd photo at least 1 week after your first.
\item Take your 3rd photo at least 4 weeks after your first AND at least 1 week after your second.
\end{enumerate}
If you are unable to get good sunset pictures, make sure to upload your attempts. We can give you partial credit.
& \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\slidepath{9}}\\\hline
Annotated photo
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take one of your photos and mark on it the positions of the sunsets from your other photos.
\item Based on the angular scale of your camera (from calibrating it in Lab 2), predict where the sunset will shift to on 21 Jun/Dec.

You can make use of your calibration grid pictures.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Photo Policy Acknowledgement}\label{sec:proj_pol}

You will need to take several photos of the setting Sun over the course of the semester following specific directions. Taking these photos is not difficult, but it does require some advance planning. Picture requirements will be described in lab and on Moodle, but a cell phone camera is fine.

You will need to upload your own original pictures taken this semester into Moodle over the course of the semester. Submitting pictures you didn't take yourself this semester, or helping someone else to submit pictures that are not their own, is considered plagiarism and/or academic dishonesty and will be handled in accordance with the UMass Academic Honesty Policy, and may result in penalties up to a zero for the entire project.

You are responsible for saving backups of your pictures immediately, so a lost or broken phone/camera/computer is not an excuse for failing to submit your pictures on time. You can upload your pictures into Moodle as you take them and save backups of your pictures using UMass OneDrive, for example.

If you have any special circumstances that will not allow you to take sunset photos for your project. You must contact your lab instructor right away to explain the circumstances and come to alternative arrangements with them.

Please indicate that you understand these policies by typing "Y" or "yes":
